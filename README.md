# Code-Refactor

## Description
This project consisted of refactoring existing code for a website's homepage. Rather than changing the function of the code, my goals were to make the site more accessible and  the code more efficient. I cleaned up the CSS by consolidating elements to eliminate redundancies and adding comments to make it easier to understand. I also improved the structure to make it more logical. I added semantic elements to the HTML as well as alt text to all of the images to make the site much more accessible.

My motivations were to better understand how to make a site accessible, and to learn about what efficient and inefficient code look like. I learned about how HTML and CSS interact, as well as what it means to add semantic elements to HTML.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
There are three links on the upper right corner of the page in the navbar (see screenshot). They each link to their corresponding page section, so a user can simply click the link they want without having to scroll down the page looking for a specific section.
